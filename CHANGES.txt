- we've ditched lucene in favor of Xapian (http://www.xapian.org).
  this app therefore requires the Public.Xapian module to be installed.

- Added ability to create multiple indices per server instance.
- Index stability seems to be better, though Lucene apparently is
  touchy about how the index is modified.
