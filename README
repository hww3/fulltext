Indexing support for various file formats

The indexer has built in support for plain text files and HTML. You may add support for 
additional file formats by telling the engine about programs that can convert other formats
to HTML or plain text.

Some examples that have been successfully tested:

PDF

http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/

Install pdftohtml and then add the following to your FullText config file:

[transform_pdf]
type=converter
mimetype=application/pdf
command=/usr/local/bin/pdftohtml -stdout -q %f


RTF

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtf2html-lite/

The free tool, rtf2html, can be used to process rtf files. However, out of the box,
this tool does not behave as either a filter or converter. A simple script is included
in the extras folder which can be used to make the rtf2html utility behave in a compatible
mannter.

Install rtf2html, edit the rtf2html_converter script appropriately,  and then add the 
following to your FullText config file:

[transform_rtf]
type=converter
mimetype=text/rtf
command=/path/to/extras/rtf2html_converter %f

DOC/DOCX/ODT/ABW

AbiWord can load various Word/OpenOffice formats and includes a tool called "AbiCommand"
that can be used to read a file and convert it into HTML format. The actual implementation
is left as an exercise to for the reader, however, the following page includes almost
everything a user might need to make this happen. Hint: start with the RTF filter above.

OTHERS

Apache Tika seems like it could be a useful tool, it includes support for a number 
of popular file formats and has an out of the box command line utility.

Drawbacks include:

- written in java, so not exactly nimble
- this, combined with the fact that it's an apache project means it has a 
  ridiculous dependency tree
